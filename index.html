            <p>
                <h3>Education:</h3><p>Jaypee Institute of Information Technology,Sector 62,Noida</p>

                <h3>My Interests and Work Domain:</h3>
                As a web developer, I am a creator of the digital world, crafting intuitive, functional, and visually appealing websites and applications that bring ideas to life. I combine creativity with technical expertise to design seamless user experiences that work beautifully across all devices and screen sizes. With a strong command of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I build responsive and dynamic interfaces, often leveraging frameworks like React to streamline development. On the back-end, I work with technologies such as Node.js and Python to handle server-side logic and database management.  

                My role is more than just writing code—it's about solving problems, optimizing performance, and ensuring that my work is accessible to everyone. I thrive in a fast-paced, ever-evolving industry, continuously learning new tools, frameworks, and best practices to stay ahead of the curve. Whether I’m developing an e-commerce platform, a portfolio website, or a complex application, I take pride in creating solutions that connect people, ideas, and businesses in meaningful ways. As a web developer, I don’t just build websites—I shape how people interact with technology every day.</p>
